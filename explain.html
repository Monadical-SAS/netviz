If you've searched for explanations of neural networks on the internet, you've probably seen two kinds of things: 
</p>
<p>
<!-- show a graph of nodes here -->
Diagrams of nodes
</p>
<p>
<!-- show a mathematical equation here -->
And messes of mathematical symbols.
</p>
<p>
These two representations of neural networks are at two different levels of abstraction.
<!-- make a comparison to python & dis? -->
</p>
<!--
- Linear transformations
- Applying a sigmoid
- Composing a graph of functions
- Graphs of graphs
- Gradients
- Gradient descent
- Putting it all together
