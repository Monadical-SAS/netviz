<h3> Intelligence </h3>
<p> I've been fascinated by cognition for as long as I can remember. Intelligence is the defining charactistic of humankind, and so mysterious that there remain <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/#MinBodHisDua">active debates</a> among philosophers as to whether our minds are governed by the same natural laws as our physical bodies.</p>
<p> I've always felt that, to understand intelligence, we should study the brain. 

<h3> Neurons </h3>
<p>An artificial neural network consists of many interconnected units of computation that are modeled after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron">elecrically-activated cells</a> in our brains and spinal cords. They looks kind of like this:</p>

<p>Neurons recieve inputs from  other activated neurons, and when the weighted sum of those inputs exceeds a threshold, it becomes active itself.</p>
<p>Mathematically speaking, the input to a neuron is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function">linear function</a> </p>
<p> $( f(x_0, x_1)=w_0 x_0 + w_1 x_1 )$ </p>
<p> where </p>
<p> $( x_0, x_1 )$ are the outputs of the incoming neurons, and</p>
<p> $( w_0, w_1 )$ are how much each of those inputs is weighted.</p>

And messes of mathematical symbols.

<p>
These two representations of neural networks are at two different levels of abstraction.
<!-- make a comparison to python & dis? -->

<!--
- Linear transformations
- Applying a sigmoid
- Composing a graph of functions
- Graphs of graphs
- Gradients
- Gradient descent
- Putting it all together
