# Netviz

This is a work in progress.

The goal of this project is to build a tool for understanding how neural networks work without having to do any kind of symbol manipulation. I feel that I'm able to much more deeply understand the way something works if I have access to a visual isomorphism that I can play with. Inspired a little bit by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/).

This project is a direct descendant of [a demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html) in [Karpathy's ConvnetJS library](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs).
